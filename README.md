# FourEyes

FourEyes provides a library for accessing Google Goggles. The goal is to 
allow anyone to easily build applications on top of the service in both
Objective-C and Python.

## Status

The current code is basically just a translation of 
http://notanothercodeblog.blogspot.com/2011_02_01_archive.html to Python.

It is merely a proof-of-concept that accessing Goggles is feasible. In
addition to that, you should keep in mind that you are building your stuff
on top of Goggles at your own risk as this project is in no way affiliated
with Google.

## Usage

<pre>$ ./goggles.py hello.jpg
Hello, goggles! Text</pre>
